"""Minimal random coding (likelihood decoder) definitions.

This is the code to be used to simulate the minimum random coding algorithm. The
algorithm was introduced by Havasi et al. in "Minimal Random Code Learning:
Getting Bits Back from Compressed Model Parameters" -
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.00440.pdf.

For brevity, we may refer to it as 'MIRACLE', although technically this refers
to the complete model compression pipeline of Havasi et al.

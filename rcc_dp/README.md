### Dependencies:

In order to successfully execute the code, the following libraries must be installed:

Python --- json, math, time, matplotlib, numpy, scipy, [absl](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-py), [ml_collections](https://github.com/google/ml_collections)

### Wrapper functions:

This repository contains the code for (a) mean estimation and (b) frequency estimation. To run the code, a wrapper function needs to be written. For example, to run the mean estimation code, the following could be used:

```
from mean_estimation import config as defaults
from mean_estimation import experiment
from mean_estimation import experiment_coding_cost

def main():
	config = defaults.get_config()
	experiment.evaluate('path-to-the-mean-estimation-code', config)
	
if __name__ == "__main__":
	main()
```

Similarly, to run the frequency estimation code, the following could be used:

```
from frequency_estimation import config as defaults
from frequency_estimation import experiment
from frequency_estimation import experiment_coding_cost

def main():
	config = defaults.get_config()
	experiment.evaluate('path-to-the-frequency-estimation-code', config)
	
if __name__ == "__main__":
	main()
```

### Reproducing the figures

1. To reproduce Figure 1(Top), make the following changes in mean_estimation/config.py:
```
num_itr = 10
vary = "cc"
```
and add the following commands in the main function of the wrapper:
```
config = defaults.get_config()
experiment_coding_cost.evaluate('path-to-the-mean-estimation-code', config)
```
2. To reproduce Figure 1(Bottom), make the following changes in mean_estimation/config.py:
```
num_itr = 10
vary = "eps"

config = defaults.get_config()
experiment.evaluate('path-to-the-mean-estimation-code', config)
```
3. To reproduce Figure 2(Top), make the following changes in frequency_estimation/config.py:

```
7. To reproduce Figure 4(Right), make the following changes in mean_estimation/config.py:
```
num_itr = 10
vary = "n"
```

        "One note on initialization below: it is difficult to initialize the two descent-based schemes and the fixed-point based algorithm identically. In order to ensure similar initialization, it is easiest to select a *vector* (corresponding to the parameterization of the fixed-point algorithm), and attempt to generate a matrix from this vector. Generating this matrix, however, essentially takes advantage of the representations which yield the fixed-point problem--and this generated matrix usually has significantly lower loss than a general positive definite matrix with constant 1s on the diagonal. This observation is not necessarily surprising; the dimensionalities involved in a vector parameterization are much lower. It is slightly unfair to the fixed-point method to 'allow' the gradient-based methods to use this initialization; but since the fixed-point method is the one we propose, we reserve the right to make it look slightly worse than it otherwise might."
